RTC-Tools documentation
=======================

RTC-Tools is an open-source platform for the operational optimization of
portfolios of assets, in particular storage assets such as hydropower
reservoirs and battery energy storage systems (BESS). RTC-Tools is part of
`LF Energy <https://lfenergy.org/>`_.

In water management, RTC-Tools is used for model-predictive control of water
systems including turbines, pumps, weirs, and reservoirs.

In power trading, the RTC-Tools project aims to move the field of trading
optimization towards increased transparency, increased code-reuse, and
higher trading value capture.

The RTC-Tools project was originally initiated at `Deltares <https://www.deltares.nl/>`_
and is deployed for water and power trading applications across the globe,
across North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

For applications in water management, `Deltares <https://www.deltares.nl/>`_ offers
commercial support.

For applications in power trading, `PortfolioEnergy <https://www.portfolioenergy.com/>`_
offers commercial support.

This first chapter of this documentation covers getting the software running on your
computer.  The subsequent two chapters describe the RTC-Tools Python API.  The fourth
and final chapter discusses several illustrative examples, including the use of goal
programming for multi-objective optimization, as well as the use of forecast
ensembles.
